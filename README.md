Jiboner-Songram-2
```
7980 AD. An ancient robotic alien power decided to exterminate 
human infestation from the universe. Earth is under attack.

Thankfully, you have prepared for an alien robot invasion all your 
life. You fight your way through the invading forces using a makeshift EMP 
gun. You are able to get to your ship - a rusty peice of scrap metal 
you inherited from some grand-relative. Explosions engulf your 
hometown as you fly into space.

You are one of the last surviving members of the human race. 
All you know about the mysterious enemy is that it is powerful. 
And it has restricted movement to a single plane ? [see controls]

You head out into the darkness, to look for answers, 
to fight for the survival of the human race....
